	abstract = {We propose inference tools for least angle regression and the lasso, from the joint distribution of suitably normalized spacings of the {LARS} algorithm. From this we extend the results of the asymptotic null distribution of the "covariance test" of Lockhart et al (2013). But we go much further, deriving exact finite sample results for a new asymptotically equivalent procedure called the "spacing test". This provides exact conditional tests at any step of the {LAR} algorithm as well as "selection intervals" for the appropriate true underlying regression parameter. Remarkably, these tests and intervals account correctly for the adaptive selection done by {LARS}.},

	abstract = {High-dimensional statistical inference deals with models in which the the number of parameters pp is comparable to or larger than the sample size nn. Since it is usually impossible to obtain consistent procedures unless p/n→0p/n{\textbackslash}rightarrow0, a line of recent work has studied models with various types of low-dimensional structure, including sparse vectors, sparse and structured matrices, low-rank matrices and combinations thereof. In such settings, a general approach to estimation is to solve a regularized optimization problem, which combines a loss function measuring how well the model fits the data with some regularization function that encourages the assumed structure. This paper provides a unified framework for establishing consistency and convergence rates for such regularized {MM}-estimators under high-dimensional scaling. We state one main theorem and show how it can be used to re-derive some existing results, and also to obtain a number of new results on consistency and convergence rates, in both ℓ2{\textbackslash}ell\_\{2\}-error and related norms. Our analysis also identifies two key properties of loss and regularization functions, referred to as restricted strong convexity and decomposability, that ensure corresponding regularized {MM}-estimators have fast convergence rates and which are optimal in many well-studied cases.},

	Abstract = {We provide stronger and more general primal-dual convergence results for Frank-Wolfe-type algorithms (a.k.a. conditional gradient) for constrained convex optimization, enabled by a simple framework of duality gap certificates. Our analysis also holds if the linear subproblems are only solved approximately (as well as if the gradients are inexact), and is proven to be worst-case optimal in the sparsity of the obtained solutions. On the application side, this allows us to unify a large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated, including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices, permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices. We present a new general framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas of this approach.},
